      [Doppelgaenger]
      source_module = Foo::Bar
      strip_pod = 1

DESCRIPTION
    This Dist::Zilla plugin creates a new CPAN distribution with a new name
    based on the latest stable distribution of a source module.

    Please do not do this without the permission of the authors or
    maintainers of the source.

    If the Changes files is flagged to be updated, you must have "{{$NEXT}}"
    in your Changes files and use the "NextRelease" plugin. The source
    distribution will be added on a line in the Changes file after
    "{{$NEXT}}". After release, your original Changes file might look
    something like this:

      0.001     2010-12-17 08:37:08 EST5EDT

        - Generated from AUTHOR/Foo-Bar-1.23.tar.gz

    If you strip Pod, you may with to explore replacing it with new Pod
    using the Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AppendExternalData plugin.

ATTRIBUTES
  source_module (REQUIRED)
    The name of a CPAN module to imitate. E.g. Foo::Bar

  new_name
    The new name to use in place of the source name. Defaults to the
    converted form of the distribution name.

  cpan_mirror
    This is a URI to a CPAN mirror. It must be an 'http' URI. Defaults to
    "http://www.cpan.org/"

  strip_version
    Boolean for whether any assignments to $VERSION should be stripped out

    containing such assignments. This obviously may not work in all cases
    and should be used with caution. Default is false.

    Boolean for whether Pod should be stripped when copying from source.
    Default is false.

  changes_file
    Name of change log file. Defaults to 'Changes'.

  update_changes_file

    distribution when built. Default is true.
