DESCRIPTION
    This Dist::Zilla plugin creates a new CPAN distribution with a new name
    based on the latest stable distribution of a source module.

    maintainers of the source.

    If the Changes files is flagged to be updated, you must have "{{$NEXT}}"
    in your Changes files and use the "NextRelease" plugin. The source
    distribution will be added on a line in the Changes file after
    "{{$NEXT}}". After release, your original Changes file might look
    something like this:

        - Generated from AUTHOR/Foo-Bar-1.23.tar.gz

    If you strip Pod, you may with to explore replacing it with new Pod
    using the Dist::Zilla::Plugin::AppendExternalData plugin.

    The name of a CPAN module to imitate. E.g. Foo::Bar

  new_name

    Default is false.

  changes_file
    Name of change log file. Defaults to 'Changes'.

    distribution when built. Default is true.
